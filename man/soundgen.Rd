\arguments{
\item{repeatBout}{the number of times the whole bout should be repeated}

\item{nSyl}{the number of syllables in the bout. Intonation, amplitude, and
formants contours span multiple syllables, but not multiple bouts (see
Details)}

\item{sylLen}{average duration of each syllable, ms}

\item{pauseLen}{average duration of pauses between syllables, ms}

\item{pitchAnchors}{dataframe specifying the time (ms) and value (Hz) of
pitch anchors. These anchors are used to create a smooth contour of
fundamental frequency f0 (pitch) within one syllable (see Examples)}

\item{pitchAnchorsGlobal}{unlike \code{pitchAnchors}, this dataframe is used
to create a smooth contour of average f0 across multiple syllables}

\item{temperature}{hyperparameter for regulating the amount of stochasticity
in sound generation}

\item{tempEffects}{a list of scale factors regulating the effect of
temperature on particular parameters. To change, specify just those pars
that you want to modify, don't rewrite the whole list (defaults are
hard-coded). \code{sylLenDep}: random variation of the duration of
syllables and pauses; \code{formDrift}: the amount of random drift of
formants; \code{formDisp}: irregularity of the dispersion of stochastic
formants; \code{pitchDriftDep}: amount of slow random drift of f0;
\code{pitchDriftFreq}: frequency of slow random drift of f0;
\code{pitchAnchorsDep, noiseAnchorsDep, amplAnchorsDep}: random
fluctuations of user-specified pitch / noise / amplitude anchors}

\item{maleFemale}{hyperparameter for shifting f0 contour, formants, and
vocalTract to make the speaker appear more male (-1...0) or more female
(0...+1)}

\item{creakyBreathy}{hyperparameter for a rough adjustment of voice quality
from creaky (-1) to breathy (+1)}

\item{pitchEffectsAmount}{hyperparameter for regulating the (approximate)
proportion of sound with different regimes of pitch effects (none /
subharmonics only / subharmonics and jitter). 0\% = no noise; 100\% = the
entire sound has jitter + subharmonics. Ignored if temperature = 0}

\item{pitchEffectsIntensity}{hyperparameter for regulating the intensity of
subharmonics and jitter, 0 to 100\% (50\% = jitter and subharmonics are as
specified, <50\% weaker, >50\% stronger). Ignored if temperature = 0}

\item{jitterLen}{duration of stable periods between pitch jumps, ms. Use a
low value for harsh noise, a high value for irregular vibrato or shaky
voice}

\item{jitterDep}{cycle-to-cycle random pitch variation, semitones}

\item{vibratoFreq}{the rate of regular pitch modulation, or vibrato, Hz}

\item{vibratoDep}{the depth of vibrato, semitones}

\item{shimmerDep}{random variation in amplitude between individual glottal
cycles (0 to 100\% of original amplitude of each cycle)}

\item{attackLen}{duration of fade-in / fade-out at each end of syllables and
noise (ms)}

\item{rolloff}{basic rolloff at a constant rate of \code{rolloff} db/octave
(exponential decay). See \code{\link{getRolloff}} for more details}

\item{rolloffOct}{basic rolloff changes from lower to upper
harmonics (regardless of f0) by \code{rolloffOct} dB/oct. For
example, we can get steeper rolloff in the upper part of the spectrum}

\item{rolloffKHz}{rolloff changes linearly with f0 by
\code{rolloffKHz} dB/kHz. For ex., -6 dB/kHz gives a 6 dB
steeper basic rolloff as f0 goes up by 1000 Hz}

\item{rolloffParab}{an optional quadratic term affecting only the
first \code{rolloffParabHarm} harmonics. The middle harmonic
of the first \code{rolloffParabHarm} harmonics is amplified or
dampened by \code{rolloffParab} dB relative to the basic
exponential decay.}

\item{rolloffParabHarm}{the number of harmonics affected by
\code{rolloffParab}}

\item{rolloffLip}{the effect of lip radiation on source spectrum, dB/oct
(the default of +6 dB/oct produces a high-frequency boost when the mouth is
open)}

\item{formants}{either a character string like "aaui" referring to default
presets for speaker "M1" or a list of formant times, frequencies,
amplitudes, and bandwidths (see ex. below). \code{formants = NA} defaults
to schwa. Time stamps for formants and mouthOpening can be specified in ms
or an any other arbitarary scale. See \code{\link{getSpectralEnvelope}} for more details}

\item{formantDep}{scale factor of formant amplitude (1 = no change relative
to amplitudes in \code{formants})}

\item{formantDepStoch}{the amplitude of additional stochastic formants added above
the highest specified formant, dB (only if temperature > 0)}

\item{vocalTract}{the length of vocal tract, cm. Used for calculating formant
dispersion (for adding extra formants) and formant transitions as the mouth
opens and closes}

\item{subFreq}{target frequency of subharmonics, Hz (lower than f0, adjusted
dynamically so f0 is always a multiple of subFreq)}

\item{subDep}{the width of subharmonic band, Hz. Regulates how quickly the
strength of subharmonics fades as they move away from harmonics in f0
stack. Low values produce narrow sidebands, high values produce uniformly
strong subharmonics}

\item{shortestEpoch}{minimum duration of each epoch with unchanging
subharmonics regime, in ms}

\item{trillDep}{amplitude modulation depth. 0: no change; 1: amplitude
modulation with amplitude range equal to the dynamic range of the sound}

\item{trillFreq}{amplitude modulation frequency, Hz}

\item{noiseAnchors}{dataframe specifying the time (ms) and amplitude (dB) of
anchors for generating the noise component such as aspiration, hissing, etc}

\item{formantsNoise}{the same as \code{formants}, but for the
noise component instead of the harmonic component. If NA (default), the
noise component will be filtered through the same formants as the harmonic
component, approximating aspiration noise [h]}

\item{rolloffNoise}{rolloff of noise, dB/octave. It is analogous to
\code{rolloff}, but while \code{rolloff} applies to the harmonic component,
\code{rolloffNoise} applies to the noise component}

\item{mouthAnchors}{dataframe specifying the time (ms) and value (0 to 1) of
mouth-opening anchors}

\item{amplAnchors}{dataframe specifying the time (ms) and value (0 to 1) of
amplitude anchors}

\item{amplAnchorsGlobal}{dataframe specifying the time (ms) and value (0 to
1) of global amplitude anchors, i.e. spanning multiple syllables}

\item{samplingRate}{sampling frequency, Hz}

\item{windowLength}{length of FFT window, ms}

\item{overlap}{FFT window overlap, \%}

\item{addSilence}{silence before and after the bout, ms}

\item{pitchFloor, pitchCeiling}{lower & upper bounds of f0}

\item{pitchSamplingRate}{sampling frequency of the pitch contour only, Hz. Low
values reduce processing time. A rule of thumb is to set this to
the same value as \code{pitchCeiling}}

\item{throwaway}{discard harmonics and noise that are quieter than this
number (in dB) to save computational resources}

\item{invalidArgAction}{what to do if an argument is invalid or outside the
range in \code{permittedValues}: 'adjust' = reset to default value, 'abort'
= stop execution, 'ignore' = throw a warning and continue (may crash)}

\item{plot}{if TRUE, plots a spectrogram}

\item{play}{if TRUE, plays the synthesized sound}

\item{savePath}{full path for saving the output, e.g. '~/Downloads/temp.wav'.
If NA (default), doesn't save anything}

\item{...}{other plotting parameters passed to \code{\link{spectrogram}}}
}
\value{
Returns the synthesized waveform as a numeric vector.

\description{
Generates a bout of one or more syllables with pauses between them. Two basic
components are synthesized: the harmonic component (the sum of sine waves
with frequencies that are multiples of the fundamental frequency) and the
noise component. Both components can be filtered with independently specified
formants. Intonation and amplitude contours can be applied both within each
syllable and across multiple syllables. Suggested application: synthesis of
animal or human non-linguistic vocalizations. For more information, see
\url{http://cogsci.se/soundgen.html} and the vignette on sound generation.
